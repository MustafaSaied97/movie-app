Responsive Movie-App is made by Next.js 13 , 
for styling I used Tailwind css
and for fetching data I used the MovieDatabaseApi 

the app contains 3 pages:

1- a main page  displays all movies that the user is searching for
also, all movies that are selected by cataogries

2- movie details page for displaying  additional details for each movie

3- favorite page for displaying  favorite movies that the user was selected
